# ⚡ PowerShell Playground

Welcome to my ever-evolving collection of **PowerShell scripts, functions, snippets, prompts, and more**. This repo is a living archive of tools I've built, tweaked, and occasionally resurrected from the depths of old code. I'm constantly adding new content and slowly refining the old stuff to make it worthy of sharing 😆.

## 🧠 What's Inside?

This repository is a mixed bag of practical PowerShell magic, with a strong focus on:

- 🏢 **Active Directory** & **Entra ID**
- 📧 **Exchange Server** & **Microsoft 365**
- ☁️ **Azure** & **AWS**
- 🔧 **Azure Pipelines** & automation tooling
- 🛠️ General PowerShell utilities and helpers

You never know what other nuggets might pop up—this is a sandbox for experimentation and discovery.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repo and explore the folders. Each script is documented (or getting there), and many are plug-and-play for your environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thekaranjit/CloudScriptLab.git
